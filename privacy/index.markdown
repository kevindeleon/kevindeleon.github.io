## SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE

We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so.

## SECTION 4 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.

However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.

For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.

In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.

As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.

Once you leave our store&rsquo;s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy.

### Links

When you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.

## SECTION 5 - SECURITY

## SECTION 6 - COOKIES

When you access our website, we may send one or more cookies to your computer. By sending you cookies with values that are unique, we may be able to uniquely identify your web browser or device when you access our website. We may use both &ldquo;session&rdquo; and &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track various types of information. A session cookie is one that is intended to disappear after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser (and may be used by your browser to identify itself when you later return to our website). Persistent cookies generally can be removed. We use cookies to retain your session states and to offer you a personalized experience on our website.

If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it.

If our site is acquired or merged with another company, your information may be transferred to the new owners so that we may continue to contact you in your preferred method, as consented to previously.
