<h1 class="headline">Are you really interested in this stuff?<&#47;h1></p>
<p>Well, here it goes then!<&#47;p></p>
<p>I am a web developer living in New Orleans, LA. I graduated from &hellip; you know what &hellip; all this stuff is on my <a href="&#47;resume&#47;">resume<&#47;a> page.  Let&rsquo;s get to the good stuff!<&#47;p></p>
<p>I was born in Bogalusa, La (don't worry, most people don&rsquo;t have any clue where that is either).  I have an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;amandadeleon.com" target="_blank">amazing wife<&#47;a>, a guitar addiction, a passion for Saints football that is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;kevindeleon&#47;sets&#47;72157627502472045&#47;" target="_blank">borderline un-healthy<&#47;a> and a new-found love in home recording.  I live in one of the most amazing cities in the world.  It&rsquo;s not perfect, but neither am I.<&#47;p></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a pretty <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kevindeleonphotography.com" target="_blank">damn good photographer<&#47;a>.  I love shooting rock shows and people (with a camera of course).<&#47;p></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to contact me, head on over to the <a href="&#47;connect&#47;">connect<&#47;a> page and we&rsquo;ll get the conversation going.<&#47;p> </p>
