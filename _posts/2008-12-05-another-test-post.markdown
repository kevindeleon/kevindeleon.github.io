I have been working for a company based in Wilmington, NC, All-Spec Industries, and my goal for last 3 months has been to completely re-design the e-commerce website.

It has been a huge undertaking, and with the help of another developer, we are actually nearing the finish line.

I plan on writing a few blog posts discussing the ups and downs of the process, along with screenshots of the new and old sites.

Keep your fingers crossed!
