    Just testing to see what comments look like.

    Hopefully by the time YOU see this, it looks pretty awesome ;-)

<p>So for the last 6 years or so, my website&#47;portfolio&#47;blog has been hosted under the domain mydesigncouldbeatupyourdesign.com.  I really liked the domain name, but as you can imagine, I had some problems communicating it to others verbally.  So, after some thought and some re-designing, I have re-launched under the domain kdeleon3.site</p>
<p>The site is a lot more streamlined, and in my opinion quite a bit easier on the eyes.  Let me know what you think, and if there is anything that you feel could be changed for the better, shoot me an email, or leave me a comment (who knows...I may just use your idea).</p>
