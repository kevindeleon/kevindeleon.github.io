<p>Well. I joined <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;kevindeleon">Twitter<&#47;a>, and so far I like it. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s actually quite an interesting concept really.</p>
<p>At first, Twitter seemed like another lame 2.0 app that to me really had no reason to exist. I mean who in their right mind wants everyone to know what they are doing at any given second, and on top of that, you actually have to be narcissistic enough to think anyone actually cares. Well, I was right, but I was also very wrong.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-99"></a></p>
<p>Twitter is quite the growing phenomenon, and it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s hard to explain. I guess it really isn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t any different than IM&acirc;&euro;&trade;ng, blogging, or social networking when you get down to it, but Twitter is quicker. It allows you to jot down a quick note, and everyone you are friends with can see it at the same time, almost instantly&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;And that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s what we are all looking for in this Web 2.0 world right? Instant information. Twitter forces you to be concise (140 characters or less), and for some, including myself, that can be hard to do.</p>
<p>As for features, Twitter is pretty streamline, and to the point. Phone, and IM integration is very nice, and the ability to make things private (for friends only) or public is also nice for those who are a bit protective about their goings on. A bit of advice&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;If you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have unlimited texting on your phone&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;just say &acirc;&euro;&oelig;NO!!&acirc;&euro;¬ù to the Phone option.</p>
<p>As for uses, there are more and more springing up all the time. Businesses are using it to keep up with what their employees are doing, news agencies are using it, etc&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; As for me, I just use it as a quicker form of IM&acirc;&euro;&trade;ing, mini-blogging, link passing, and for comic relief. The people I tend to follow are wise asses ;)</p>
<p>Twitter also seems to be quite the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Equalizer,&acirc;&euro;&trade; so to speak. What I mean by that is, I am following quite a few people I highly respect in the industry, and while I have never met these people, I feel like if we meet in person, I won&acirc;&euro;&trade;t feel like I have never met them. Odd really&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;but true. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.w3conversions.com">Stephanie Sullivan of W3Conversions<&#47;a>, does a better job of explaining this than I do <a href="http:&#47;&#47;communitymx.com&#47;blog&#47;index.cfm?newsid=902&blogger=15">over at her blog<&#47;a>, and also has a pretty cool new users tutorial that goes along with it.</p>
<p>Well, that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s about it really. While I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t think Twitter is a huge Godsend of an application&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;it is pretty cool. I definitely will continue using it, and if you want to follow me (I have no idea why&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;but I am pretty damn funny!), http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;kdeleon</p>
<p>Happy Twittering&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;(That&acirc;&euro;&trade;s for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;abraham.dizandat.com&#47;">Abraham<&#47;a>...he HATES it when I turn things into verbs).</p>
